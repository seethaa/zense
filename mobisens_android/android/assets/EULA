This application is created to collect data from the embedded sensors in the Android phone including Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope (If available), Ambient Light sensor, GPS and Compass. The application will also collect power consumption and Mac address as well as signal strength of surrounding WIFI access points. These data will only be used for the purpose of this particular research project. We will not collect any identify information such as user name, phone number or email address from your phone.

When the application is running. It will transmit the recorded data to server periodically, where it will be available for our researchers. If you want to stop the data collection, you can stop these services from the applicationâ€™s main screen. Once the data collection service is stopped, no data will be collected and transmitted, however, you may still receive message from server. If you want to stop participating in our study, you can uninstall the application at any time.

Participating in this study may not benefit you directly, but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity.
